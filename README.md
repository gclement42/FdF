<h1>FDF</h1>

<i> This project was made at the 42 school context. </i><br><br>
The FDF project aims to graphically create the schematic representation of a relief terrain. Using the MiniLibX graphics library, the program connects different points in space to generate a three-dimensional visualization of the landscape.
Objectives
The main objective is to manipulate the MiniLibX, the school's graphics library, to place points in space, connect them, and observe the scene from a certain viewpoint. The rendering should be displayed using an isometric projection.
